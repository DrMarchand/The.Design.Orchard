## Universal Design for Learning (UDL) Anchors
- **Multiple Means of Engagement**: choice boards, interests, regulation options.
- **Multiple Means of Representation**: visuals, audio, tactile, captions, ASL support.
- **Multiple Means of Action & Expression**: speak, draw, build, perform, type.

## Assistive Technology Compatibility
- Text-to-speech & speech-to-text pathways in all tasks.
- Keyboard-only navigation; ARIA roles; high-contrast themes.
- Alt text for all images; transcript for audio; captions for video.
- Fine-motor alternatives (switch input, dwell select).

## IEP/504 Alignment
- Link accommodations to tasks (read-aloud, extended time, reduced load).
- Provide goal tracking by **growth bands** not single cut scores.};
