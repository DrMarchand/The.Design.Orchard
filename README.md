## 🌱 What Is Design Orchard?

**Design Orchard LLC** is a professional design and systems entity focused on the cultivation of
**coherent visual architectures**.

This is not a portfolio.  
This is not open source.  
This is not education.

This is a **publishing and governance layer** for design intelligence.
